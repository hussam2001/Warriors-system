## ‚ö° Render Free Tier Notes

**Limitations:**
- Service spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after spin-down takes ~30-60 seconds
- 750 hours free per month
- 100 GB bandwidth limit

**Solutions:**
- Use Render's paid plan ($7/month) for always-on service
- Or keep the service active by visiting it regularly
- For production use, consider upgrading to paid plan

## üîí Security Reminder

- Your website will be publicly accessible if repository is public
- Consider making repository **Private** on GitHub if you only want specific people to access it
- Render doesn't offer built-in password protection on free tier

## üìä Features That Will Work

‚úÖ Payments Tracking  
‚úÖ Reports & Analytics

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails:**
- Check that all dependencies are in package.json
- Look at Render build logs for errors (click on your service ‚Üí Logs)
- Make sure next.config.js is properly configured
- Ensure `distDir: process.env.ELECTRON ? 'out' : '.next'` is set correctly
- Check that port is set correctly (Render automatically sets PORT env variable)

**Can't access website:**
- Check Render dashboard for deployment status
- Ensure GitHub repository is properly connected
- Verify build completed successfully (green checkmark)
- First load may take 30-60 seconds if service was spun down

**Service is slow/freezing:**
- Free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after spin-down takes time to wake up
- Consider upgrading to paid plan ($7/month) for always-on service
- Or set up a cron job to ping the service every 10 minutes

**Database errors:**
- Supabase credentials are already set up
- Check internet connection
- Verify Supabase project is active
- Check Supabase dashboard for service status

**Port errors:**
- Render uses PORT environment variable automatically
- Make sure your app listens on `process.env.PORT || 3000`
- Next.js handles this automatically

2. Create a new cron job
3. URL: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`
