   - "Warriors system" (if that's the folder name)
   - OR whatever folder name you see on GitHub
6. Click "Save Changes"
7. Render will auto-redeploy
8. Wait 5 minutes

SOLUTION 2: FIX GITHUB STRUCTURE (BETTER)
═══════════════════════════════════════

1. Go to: https://github.com/hussam2001/WARRIORS
2. Look at the folder structure
3. If you see something like:
   
   WARRIORS/
     📁 Warriors system/    ← THIS IS THE PROBLEM!
       📄 package.json
       📁 app/
   
4. Click on "Warriors system" folder
5. Select ALL files inside
6. Drag them UP to the root of the repo
7. Delete the "Warriors system" folder
8. Now structure should be:
   
   WARRIORS/
     📄 package.json        ← AT ROOT!
     📁 app/                ← AT ROOT!
   
9. On Render, set Root Directory to: (EMPTY - blank)
10. Save and redeploy
