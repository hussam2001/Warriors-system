🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX FOR RENDER ERROR 🚨
====================================

ERROR: "Could not read package.json"

THE ISSUE:
Render is looking in the wrong place. Your files might be in a subdirectory on GitHub.

SOLUTION - ONE OF THESE:

OPTION 1: Check Your GitHub Structure ⭐ TRY THIS FIRST
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/hussam2001/WARRIORS
2. Look at the file structure
3. Is package.json in the ROOT of the repo? Or is it inside a folder?

If package.json is INSIDE a folder (like "Warriors system/"), then:
- Go to Render.com → Settings
- Find "Root Directory" field
- Enter the folder name (e.g., "Warriors system")
- Save and redeploy

OPTION 2: Fix Your GitHub Repository Structure
------------------------------------------------
If your GitHub looks like this:
📁 WARRIORS/
  📁 Warriors system/
    📄 package.json  ❌ WRONG!

It should be:
📁 WARRIORS/
  📄 package.json  ✅ CORRECT
  📁 app/
  📁 components/
  etc.

TO FIX:
1. Download your GitHub repo
2. Move ALL files from "Warriors system/" folder up to root
3. Upload everything to GitHub root
4. No nested folders!

OPTION 3: Set Root Directory in Render ⭐ EASIEST
----------------------------------------------------
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your web service
3. Go to Settings tab
4. Find "Root Directory" field
5. If your files are in a subfolder on GitHub:
   - Enter the folder name (e.g., "Warriors system")
   - Don't include the GitHub repo name, just the subfolder
6. Save changes
7. Render will redeploy automatically

WHAT TO CHECK RIGHT NOW:
----------------------------
Go to your GitHub repo and verify this structure:

✅ CORRECT Structure:
- package.json (at root)
- app/ (at root)
- components/ (at root)
- public/ (at root)
- next.config.js (at root)
- etc.

❌ WRONG Structure:
- SomeFolder/
  - package.json
  - app/
  - etc.

IF YOU SEE A NESTED FOLDER ON GITHUB:
--------------------------------------
Use Option 3 above - set Root Directory in Render!

QUICK CHECK:
------------
Visit: https://github.com/hussam2001/WARRIORS

Can you see package.json in the root list of files?
- YES → Your Root Directory should be EMPTY in Render
- NO (it's inside a folder) → Set Root Directory to that folder name

The Root Directory setting in Render should be:
- EMPTY (if files are at GitHub root)
- "Warriors system" (if files are in that subfolder)

Try this NOW and redeploy! 🚀
